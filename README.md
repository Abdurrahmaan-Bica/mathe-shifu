# Mathe-Shifu - MiniHackathon 2.0 Project 
Mathe-Shifu is an innovative learning platform that combines mathematics with the philosophy and discipline of martial arts. Our goal is to make learning mathematics both motivating and unique.



## What inspired the creation of Mathe-Shifu?
Having practiced Chinese martial arts for many years and learning a lot from the philosophy of Kung Fu, I decided to combine martial arts learning techniques with mathematical games. The goal is to entertain those who want to learn math in a fun way. In the future, I plan to introduce a category system similar to martial arts belts (e.g., white belt) and include the possibility of sparring against other users with derivatives and integrals, along with many other exciting features to come.
